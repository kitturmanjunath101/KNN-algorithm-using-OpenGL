# KNN-algorithm-using-OpenGL
his code implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) visualization using OpenGL and GLFW. It allows users to input test points interactively and displays which cluster (among three predefined clusters) the test points belong to based on the KNN algorithm. Training points are color-coded, and predictions are visually represented on the window.
